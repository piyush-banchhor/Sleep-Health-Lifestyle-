**💤 Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis**

**📌 Project Overview**


This project explores the relationship between sleep health and various lifestyle factors using a structured dataset. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that explain how daily habits such as physical activity, stress levels, and work routines impact sleep quality and duration.
The entire workflow—data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)—has been performed using Python, ensuring reproducibility and clarity.

**🎯 Objectives**


Understand the distribution and characteristics of sleep-related variables

Analyze how lifestyle factors influence sleep duration and sleep quality

Identify trends, correlations, and potential risk factors affecting sleep health

Prepare clean and well-structured data for future modeling or predictive analysis


**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**


-Python

-Pandas – data cleaning and manipulation

-NumPy – numerical computations

-Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

-Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis



**🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**


Handled missing and inconsistent values


Corrected data types and standardized column formats


Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries


Ensured overall data integrity before analysis




**📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**


The EDA focuses on:
Distribution of sleep duration and sleep quality
Lifestyle patterns across different demographic groups
Relationships between sleep, stress levels, physical activity, and work habits
Visual insights through histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps



**📈 Key Insights**


Clear associations between lifestyle habits and sleep health


Variations in sleep patterns based on activity and stress levels


Identification of factors that may contribute to poor or healthy sleep


(Detailed insights are presented through visualizations and observations in the notebook.)



**🚀 Future Scope**



Feature engineering for predictive modeling


Building machine learning models to predict sleep quality


Incorporating additional health or wearable data


Deploying insights through dashboards or reports
